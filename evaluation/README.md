# *k*-NCL evaluation

This evaluation section contains scripts, datasets, and precomputed data on experimental evaluation of the *k*-NCL tree completion algorithm. Three main aspects are explored. We examine how the parameter $k$ affects the tree completion output, compare completion-based and pruning-based tree approaches/distances, and analyze the results of two different tree completion methods.
