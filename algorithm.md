# K-NCL
**k-Nearest Common Leaves: phylogenetic tree completion algorithm**

We have 2 phylogenetic trees in Newick format. These trees have different but overlapping taxa (leaves). The tree completion process consists of making both trees defined on the same taxa (this is the union of the leaf sets of both trees) by adding distinct (non-common) leaves from one tree to the other.
