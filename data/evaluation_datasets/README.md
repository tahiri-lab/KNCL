## Datasets for the experimental evaluation of the k-NCL tree completion algorithm

In the experimental evaluation of the **k-NCL tree completion algorithm**, two versions of each biological dataset were prepared using the methodology outlined in this repository.

* **Datasets A**: Contain 50 phylogenetic trees per group and are used to evaluate the influence of the parameter `k` in the k-NCL algorithm.
* **Datasets B**: Contain a larger number of trees and are used for comparative analysis of distance metrics between completed trees.

The following table summarizes the four biological datasets used:

| **Group**  | **Dataset A (Trees)** | **Dataset B (Trees)** | **Unique Species** |
| ---------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ |
| Amphibians | 50                    | 170                   | 120                |
| Birds      | 50                    | 100                   | 135                |
| Mammals    | 50                    | 140                   | 105                |
| Sharks     | 50                    | 100                   | 95                 |
