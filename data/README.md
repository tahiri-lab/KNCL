## Datasets

This folder contains datasets of phylogenetic trees defined on different but overlapping sets of taxa.

### Simulated data

Simulated phylogenetic tree data were generated using the GPTree generator (sourses: [1](https://github.com/tahiri-lab/GPTree), [2](https://github.com/tahiri-lab/GPTree/tree/GPTreeCluster)), which is specifically designed to simulate phylogenetic trees with varying numbers of leaves and different levels of overlap. The dataset was produced by configuring the generator with parameters that included generating a total of 500 trees, setting the number of leaves to range between 20 and 30, and adjusting the overlap levels to 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7 (100 trees for each level of overlap).
