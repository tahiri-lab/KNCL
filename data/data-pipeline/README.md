## Overview
This project includes two main files that provide different ways to interact with and use the code:
1. `overlap_tree_pipeline.py` - A streamlined Python script version for non-interactive use.
2. `Biological_data_preparation.ipynb` - A Jupyter Notebook version with enhanced interactivity and additional documentation.


### `Biological_data_preparation.ipynb`
- **Description**: This Jupyter Notebook version provides an interactive way to explore and use the code.
- **Purpose**: Designed for users who want to run the code interactively and gain a deeper understanding through additional comments, suggestions, and visualizations.
- **Usage**: Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or Colab to start an interactive session.
- **Features**: 
  - Includes the same core functionality as `overlap_tree_pipeline.py`.
  - Provides additional comments and explanations to guide the user.
  - Includes cells for visualizing datasets, making it easier to understand the data overlapping distributions and analysis process.
  - Allows users to modify parameters and see the results in real-time.
